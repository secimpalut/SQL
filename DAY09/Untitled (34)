--HOW TO ALTER SEQUENCE

CREATE TABLE bank_customers
(
    customer_order_number NUMBER(3),
    customer_name VARCHAR2(50)
);

CREATE SEQUENCE seq1
START WITH 101
INCREMENT BY 2
MAXVALUE 105;

--If you want to alter a sequence, you can alter "INCREMENT BY", "MAXVALUE", "MINVALUE", open a CYCLE
--but you CANNOT ALTER "START WITH"
--Note: If you need to alter "START WITH", dropping Sequence and creating it again is recommended

--Increase MAXVALUE to 107
ALTER SEQUENCE seq1
MAXVALUE 107;

INSERT INTO bank_customers VALUES(seq1.NEXTVAL, '&customer_name');

SELECT * FROM bank_customers;

DELETE FROM bank_customers;

--Update "INCREMENT BY" to 1
DROP SEQUENCE seq1;

ALTER SEQUENCE seq1
INCREMENT BY 1;

INSERT INTO bank_customers VALUES(seq1.NEXTVAL, '&customer_name');

SELECT * FROM bank_customers;

DELETE FROM bank_customers;

--Open a CYCLE
--When you open a CYCLE if you do not declare MINVALUE, CYCLE starts with 1
ALTER SEQUENCE seq1
CYCLE
CACHE 3;

INSERT INTO bank_customers VALUES(seq1.NEXTVAL, '&customer_name');

SELECT * FROM bank_customers;
